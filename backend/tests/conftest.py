"""
Shared pytest configuration.

The suite must not depend on a live LLM. Several tests assert on the
deterministic question flow and the curated extraction paths -- they passed for
a long time only because the configured Gemini model had been retired and every
call 404'd, so the fallback always answered. The moment a working key was added
they became nondeterministic, and the suite slowed from ~50s to ~160s because it
was making real API calls.

Outbound model calls are therefore disabled by default. A test that genuinely
wants live behaviour can opt in with @pytest.mark.live_llm.
